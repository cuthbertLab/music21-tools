Demonstrations for `music21`

Copyright 2004-2018 Michael Scott Cuthbert and cuthbertLab, released under a BSD (3-clause) license.

Many of these Demonstrations were formerly in the `music21` package.  
They may require external packages to make them work, and some may require editing to make them work with the latest version
of `music21`.  They will be updated with each new major release of music21, but there is no guarantee that they will work with
any development versions along the way.

Many thanks to Beth Hadley, Jordi Bartolomé, Daniel Manesh and others who contributed to this project.
