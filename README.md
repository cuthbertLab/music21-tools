Demonstrations for `music21`

Copyright © 2004-2023 Michael Scott Asato Cuthbert, released under a BSD (3-clause) license.

Many of these Demonstrations were formerly in the `music21` package.  
They may require external packages to make them work, and some may require editing to make them work with the latest version
of `music21`.  I will attempt to update them with each new major release of `music21`, but there is no guarantee that they will work with
any development versions along the way.

Many thanks to Beth Hadley, Jordi Bartolomé, Daniel Manesh and others who contributed to this project.
